🕹️ Arduino Sensor Labyrinth

This project is an interactive Arduino-based labyrinth using multiple sensors. The goal is to trigger all sensors in sequence to complete the challenge.

⚡ Features

Push Button – The first step in the labyrinth.

Touch Sensor (KY-036) – Activate by touch.

Light Sensor (LDR) – Trigger by covering or blocking light.

Rotary Encoder – Rotate to the right three times to progress.

RGB LED and Laser – Visual feedback when the labyrinth is completed.

Buzzer – Audible signal when all steps are completed.

📝 How to Use

Press the button.

Touch the sensor.

Cover the light sensor.

Rotate the rotary encoder to the right three times.

Once all steps are completed, the RGB LED and laser light up, and the buzzer sounds.

🛠️ Requirements

Arduino Uno (or compatible)

Push button

KY-036 touch sensor

LDR light sensor

Rotary encoder

RGB LED

Buzzer

Laser module

Jumper wires and breadboard

💡 Notes

The sequence of sensor activation must be followed.

Serial Monitor shows progress and sensor activations.

This project is a fun introduction to sensor integration and interactive electronics.
